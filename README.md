Vector field navigation of an autocross course
==============================================

This is my study in using vector fields to help navigate an autocross course.
What is autocross? It is a timed driving event that uses traffic cones to build
a mini course. It tests your precision driving skills against other drivers and
cars. Check out this link at the [SCCA Solo
site](https://www.scca.com/pages/what-is-autocross) for more details. This study
is part of my overall goal of building a self-driving car capable of competing
in an autocross event. Here is a link to the first Jupyter Notebook
[eCones.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/KenBury/autocross/blob/master/eCones.ipynb).

Here is where I implemented an segmented approach to applying the vector fields.
A path was found around the 2017 Nationals east course. [eConesSegment.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/KenBury/autocross/blob/master/eConesSegment.ipynb)
