Vector field navigation of an autocross course
==============================================

This is my study in using vector fields to help navigate an autocross course.
What is autocross? It is a timed driving event that uses traffic cones to build
a mini course. It tests your precision driving skills against other drivers and
cars. Check out this link at the [SCCA Solo
site](https://www.scca.com/pages/what-is-autocross) for more details. This study
is part of my overall goal of building a self-driving car capable of competing
in an autocross event. Here is a link to the first Jupyter Notebook
[eCones.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/KenBury/vector-field/blob/master/eCones.ipynb).
